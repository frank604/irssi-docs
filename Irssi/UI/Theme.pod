=head1 THEME DOCUMENTATION

When testing changes, the easiest way to reload the theme is with /RELOAD.
This reloads the configuration file too, so if you did any changes remember
to /SAVE it first. Remember also that /SAVE overwrites the theme file with
old data so keep backups C<:)>

=head2 TEMPLATES

The real text formats that irssi uses are the ones you can find with
/FORMAT command. Back in the old days all the colors and texts were mixed
up in those formats, and it was really hard to change the colors since you
might have had to change them in tens of different places. So, then came
this templating system.

Now the C</FORMAT>s don't have any colors in them, and they also have very
little other styling. Most of the stuff you need to change is in this
theme file. If you can't change something here, you can always go back
to change the /FORMATs directly, they're also saved in the  F<*.theme> files.

So, the templates. They're those C<{blahblah}> parts you see all over the
/FORMATs and here. Their usage is simply C<{name parameter1 parameter2}>.

When irssi sees this kind of text, it goes to find "name" from abstracts block
below and sets C<parameter1> into C<$0> and C<parameter2> into C<$1> (you can
have more parameters of course). Templates can have subtemplates.  Here's a
small example:

  /FORMAT format hello {colorify {underline world}}

  abstracts = { colorify = "%G$0-%n"; underline = "%U$0-%U"; }

When irssi expands the templates in "format", the final string would be:

  hello %G%Uworld%U%n

ie. underlined bright green "world" text.  and why C<$0->, why not C<$0>? C<$0>
would only mean the first parameter, $0- means all the parameters. With
{underline hello world} you'd really want to underline both of the words, not
just the hello (and world would actually be removed entirely).

=head2 COLOURS

You can find definitions for the color format codes in L<Formats>

There's one difference here though. C<%n> format. Normally it means the default
color of the terminal (white mostly), but here it means the "reset color back to
the one it was in higher template". For example if there was C</FORMAT test
%g{foo}bar>, and C<foo = "%Y$0%n">, irssi would print yellow C<"foo"> (as set
with C<%Y>) but C<"bar"> would be green, which was set at the beginning before
the C<{foo}> template. If there wasn't the C<%g> at start, the normal behaviour
of C<%n> would occur. If you I<really> want to use the terminal's default color,
use C<%N>.
